## Usage

This very much a work in progress and not ready for use yet.

Patches [bluebird](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bluebird) to work with [continuation-local-storage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/continuation-local-storage).

Only works with bluebird v3.x at present. And not tested, so may not work at all!

Based on original code by [@arthurschreiber](https://github.com/arthurschreiber).

## Tests

Use `npm test` to run the tests. Use `npm run cover` to check coverage.
